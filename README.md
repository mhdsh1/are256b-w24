## Week 1 - Jan 12
### Intro
- I'm Mahdi Shams, your TA for this course. I'm a second-year PhD student in 
  Davis ARE. 
- Originally from Tehran, Iran, I pursued my undergraduate studies in 
  engineering there and later earned my master's degree in economics in 
  Toulouse, France.
- My research focuses on the intersection of environmental policy and public 
  economics, and econometrics plays a crucial role in my work. 

- English is not my first language. My mother tongue is 
  [Farsi (Persian)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language). 
  Clarity is important to me, so please let me know if you notice any unusual 
  pronunciations. 

- I'm here to assist you, so feel free to reach out with any questions or 
  concerns!
